# Advent of Code 2025

These are just my solutions for AOC 2025, written in Elixir. I will likely drop off before the end, but I'll keep on going while it's fun.

## Running

```bash
iex -S mix
# Aoc.DayNUMBER.part_NUMBER("path/to/input"), e.g.:
Aoc.DayOne.part_one("test/fixtures/day_one/input.txt")
```

## Tests

Put your `input.txt`s into `test/fixtures/day_NUMBER/input.txt`
